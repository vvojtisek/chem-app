# Product specification

## Product goal

Build a Czech-language, offline-capable learning application for inorganic chemistry. The product should help learners practice recall, receive immediate unambiguous feedback, revisit errors, and understand their mastery without requiring a continuous network connection.

The detailed delivery sequence is maintained in [`../SPRINT_PLAN.md`](../SPRINT_PLAN.md). This document is the stable behavioral baseline; implementation plans may split it into smaller increments but must not silently change it.

## Core learning modes

### Periodic-table practice

- Scopes: first 36 or all 118 elements; chemical groups; transition metals; metals, nonmetals, and metalloids.
- Prompt to position: show a Czech name or symbol and ask the learner to select the correct table cell.
- Position to answer: highlight a cell and request a symbol/name or a four-option choice.
- In position-to-answer practice the table stays on screen through each question, its feedback, and the summary; correctly answered cells keep the element symbol until the series restarts, and incorrect cells are marked without revealing the answer.
- Give immediate correct/incorrect feedback and repeat missed elements at the end of the session.

### Chemical equations

- Filter questions by element and by production, characteristic, redox, or industrial category.
- Ask for coefficients using positive integers; a blank UI coefficient and explicit `1` both normalize to one.
- Require the lowest whole-number coefficient ratio.
- Ask for missing reactants or products by text entry or configured multiple choice.
- On error or request, show atom counts on both sides as a learning aid.

### Inorganic nomenclature

- Support oxides, hydroxides, binary acids and their salts, oxoacids, oxoacid salts, hydrogensalts, and hydrates.
- Support formula-to-Czech-name and Czech-name-to-formula practice.
- Normalize case, whitespace, Unicode, and documented formula typography.
- Strict mode accepts canonical answers and approved aliases. Tolerant mode may additionally ignore diacritics as documented; it does not guess semantic intent.

### Occurrence, production, and flashcards

- Filter by element or logical topic such as iron/steel, halogens, sulfuric acid, or nitric acid.
- Cover mineral-to-element matching and the principles, conditions, and equations of important production processes.
- Provide two-sided element cards with occurrence, important ores, preparation, production, and equations where applicable.
- “Knew it / Didn’t know it” grading drives a deterministic spaced-repetition schedule.

## Shared behavior

- Curriculum data is validated structured data, never duplicated inside UI components.
- Formula entry uses editable plain text such as `H2SO4` with an immediate typographic preview such as `H₂SO₄`.
- The desktop periodic table uses the standard 18-group layout plus lanthanide/actinide rows. At 360 px width it remains readable through a discoverable overflow interaction.
- All core interactions work with keyboard, pointer, and touch.
- Correctness, errors, selection, and mastery never rely on color alone.
- Attempts, retry state, mastery events, settings, and spaced-repetition state survive reloads and are migrated or recoverably reset across schema versions.
- After a successful initial load, core learning modes remain usable without a network connection.
- A mastery heatmap distinguishes no data from low mastery and uses a minimum evidence threshold so one correct answer is not presented as full mastery.

## MVP content baseline

- identity, table position, and category for all 118 elements;
- reviewed occurrence/production records for the first 36 elements and important industrial elements;
- at least 100 reviewed nomenclature questions;
- at least 60 reviewed reaction questions;
- at least 30 reviewed occurrence, production, or flashcard prompts.

These are planning targets, not permission to ship unreviewed material. If review capacity is constrained, correctness wins over volume.

## Out of scope for the first release

- mandatory accounts or online connectivity for core practice;
- teacher/classroom administration;
- user-authored public curriculum;
- semantic or generative answer grading;
- full coverage of advanced coordination chemistry;
- competitive scoring that treats client-recorded mastery as trusted evidence.
